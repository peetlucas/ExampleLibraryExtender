# ExampleLibraryExtender
A class library named Exercise01 that defines extension methods that extend number types such as BigInteger and int with a method named Towards that returns a string describing 
the number; for example, 18,000,000 would be eighteen million, and 18,456,002,032,011,000,007 would be eighteen quintillion, four hundred and fifty-six quadrillion, two trillion, 
thirty-two billion, eleven million, and seven. Also, a console application names Exercise02 that uses the class library in Exercise01 to take numeric input from the user and 
output the string describing the number.
